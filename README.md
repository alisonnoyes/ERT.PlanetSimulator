# ERT.PlanetSimulator
Standalone Unity program to simulate bodies orbiting around a central body.

The planet simulator allows scaling of distances, sizes, and time in order to allow real life examples such as the solar system to be simulated in an easily visible way. These are all set during runtime as well as editable values for the planets' sizes, masses, orbit radii, etc.

Users can either input values for planets they want to add, throw in a selection of planets, or load a saved preset of our solar system. User systems can also be saved in JSON format to be loaded in the future.

The program computes and displays helpful values such as the period of orbit, perihelion, aphelion, and more.
